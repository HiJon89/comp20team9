Some features have stopped working since our presentation:

1. We used to use cURL to get information from other sites.
This stopped working, and we had to switch over to file_get_contents.
Our only hypothesis is that cURL stopped working because of sessions.

2. Previously, if a movie wasn't in our db, it would load the APIs and then get added to the db.
Once a movie was in the db, our movies page would load it from there rather than from APIs.
Now, movies are no longer getting into the database at all.

Another result of this db problem is that our Movie Popularity Chart can't be dynamic.
Since we can't load movies into the db anymore, we can't keep track of pageviews.
So, we have fed dummy data into the Popularity Chart.
Our site isn't old enough or popular enough to generate interesting pageview info anyway.

3. The theaters page used to load the top 5 yelp results and top top 5 theaters results.
If a user had a favorite theater or favorite food, these would be prioritized.
These results would also be loaded onto a google map.
Now, the yelp results aren't loading at all, and the movie results aren't getting placed on the map.
We have no idea why.




We didn't allow enough time to fix these issues, because we thought the features would still be working.
